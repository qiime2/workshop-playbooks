Hello! Please find attached a copy of your server login information, as well
as some reference material to keep on hand during the upcoming QIIME 2
workshop.

**
There is nothing you need to do with this just now - please hold on to this
email and PDF for the first day of the workshop.
**

Please note, the server might not yet be accessible - we will cover logging
into the server on the first day of the workshop, so please don't worry if you
try to log in and it doesn't work. We just want to make sure you have the
material on hand now.

Thanks so much and see you soon!
